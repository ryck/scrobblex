## üí° About

Scrobblex is a self-hosted nodejs app that enables Plex scrobbling integration with Trakt via webhooks. It also allows you to push your ratings to Trakt.

Plex provides webhook integration for all Plex Pass subscribers, and users of their servers. A webhook is a request that the Plex application sends to third party services when a user takes an action, such as watching a movie or episode.

You can ask Plex to send these webhooks to this app, which will then log those plays in your Trakt account.

This tool is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Plex Inc.

This is basically a command line app, so there are no screenshots really, BUT I wanted to have at least some pretty logs:

## üöÄ Features

- Scrobble Plex plays to Trakt
- Push Plex ratings to Trakt
- Self-hosted
- No Trakt VIP account required


## üê• Getting Started

You don't need a Trakt VIP account to use this app (scrobblex will take care of that), BUT you need a Plex Pass subscription in order to have access to webhooks.

### Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryck/scrobblex.git && cd scrobblex
npm install
npm run start
```

Once Scrobblex is running, just go to http://$YOUR_IP:$PORT/ (ie: http://10.20.30.40:3090/) and a web page will guide you to get your token.

### Docker

Scrobblex is designed to be run in Docker. You can host it right on your Plex server!

To run it yourself, first create an API application through Trakt [here](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications).

Set the `Redirect URI` (previously know as `Allowed Hostnames`) to be the URI you will hit to access Scrobblex, plus /authorize.

So if you're exposing your server at http://10.20.30.40:3090, you'll set it to http://10.20.30.40:3090/authorize.

Bare IP addresses and ports are totally fine, but keep in mind your Scrobblex instance _must_ be accessible to _all_ the Plex servers you intend to play media from.

You can also have multiple URIs, one per line.

Again, once Scrobblex is running, just go to http://$YOUR_IP:$PORT/ (ie: http://127.0.0.1:3090/) and a web page will guide you to get your token.

#### Using docker run

```bash
docker run \
  --name=scrobbler \
  --restart always \
  -v <path to configs>:/app/data \
  -e TRAKT_ID=<trakt_id> \
  -e TRAKT_SECRET=<trakt_secret> \
  -p 3090:3090 \
  rickgc/scrobblex:latest
```

#### Using compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  scrobbled:
    image: rickgc/scrobblex:latest
    container_name: scrobblex
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 3090:3090
    environment:
      - TRAKT_ID=YOUR_TRAKT_ID
      - TRAKT_SECRET=YOUR_TRAKT_SECRET
    volumes:
      - ./scrobblex:/app/data
```

### FAQ
#### How to get your Plex user

You can find your plex user (don't confuse it with your Plex ID) by going to the [Plex website](https://www.plex.tv) and logging in. Your username will be in the top right corner.

Alternatively, you can find it by going to your [account settings](https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/settings/account). Your username will be below your profile picture.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Acknowledgements

[XanderStrike](https://github.com/XanderStrike) for his [goplaxt](https://github.com/XanderStrike/goplaxt) project (now sadly dicontinued). It was a great inspiration for this project. Scrobblex is basically the same thing, but in NodeJS, so kudos to him!

If you want something more powerful, (or something that doesn't need a plex pass), check [PlexTraktSync](https://github.com/Taxel/PlexTraktSync), it's an awesome project that will allow you to sync your watched media, your ratings, your lists, etc. from Plex to Trakt.
